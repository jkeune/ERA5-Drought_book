# Understanding Drought (Indices)

Drought is a complex phenomenon — it develops slowly, varies across regions, and affects different parts of the water cycle in different ways.  
Before diving deeper into ERA5-Drought, it helps to understand the types of drought, and how drought **indices** help to quantify drought and why they matter.

This page gives a short overview of the broader drought types (meteorological, agricultural, hydrological) and then focuses on two of the most widely used climate-based drought indicators: **SPI** and **SPEI**.  

For deeper reading, we link to authoritative sources such as the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**, the **European Drought Observatory (EDO)**, and the **Global Drought Observatory (GDO)**.

## Types of drought: meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological

Drought is not a single concept, as drought moves across different parts of the water cycle.  
Understanding the major drought types helps interpret what drought indices can (and cannot) capture.

### Meteorological drought

**Definition:**  
A period of significantly below-normal precipitation (Gibbs & Maher, 1967).

**Where it occurs:**  
In the **atmosphere** — expressed in rainfall anomalies.

**Indicators:**  
- Percentiles  
- Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
- Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)

**Timescale:** Weeks to months  
**Significance:** First stage of drought development.

---

### Agricultural (soil moisture) drought

**Definition:**  
Insufficient soil moisture to meet vegetation or crop needs (FAO, 2013).

**Where it occurs:**  
**Root zone and surface soils**

**Indicators:**  
- Soil moisture anomalies  
- Evaporative Stress Index (ESI)  
- NDVI/vegetation indices  
- SPEI (via temperature sensitivity)

**Timescale:** Weeks to months  
**Impacts:** Crop failures, vegetation stress, fire risk.

---

### Hydrological drought

**Definition:**  
Long-term deficits in **streamflow, groundwater, lakes, or reservoirs** (Van Loon, 2015).

**Where it occurs:**  
The **deep water cycle**

**Indicators:**  
- River discharge  
- Groundwater levels  
- Reservoir storage  

**Timescale:** Months to years  
**Impacts:** Water supply, navigation, hydropower, ecosystems.

### How drought types relate

Meteorological drought is often the **starting point** of drought development, and many drought events progress from **meteorological → agricultural → hydrological** stages. However, this sequence is **not guaranteed**, and real-world drought propagation is more complex:

- **Heatwaves** can trigger agricultural drought even when rainfall is near normal  
- **Irrigation** or groundwater pumping can temporarily buffer agricultural drought  
- **Hydrological drought** can persist long after rainfall recovers  
- **Soil characteristics, land use, and snowpack dynamics** can accelerate or delay the transition  

Because of this complexity, the **timescale** over which precipitation deficits accumulate becomes a key factor. Longer deficits generally translate into deeper and more persistent impacts across the water cycle.

A simplified view:

- **Short-term deficits (1 month / SPI-1 or SPEI-1)**  
  → Reduced soil moisture, stress on vegetation, and lower flow in small streams  

- **Seasonal deficits (3–6 months / SPI-3 to SPI-6, SPEI-3 to SPEI-6)**  
  → Lower river discharge, reduced reservoir storage, early signs of water scarcity  

- **Long-term deficits (6–12+ months / SPI-6 to SPI-12, SPEI-6 to SPEI-12)**  
  → Reduced groundwater recharge, declining aquifer levels, long-lasting hydrological drought  

In practice:

- **SPI** remains one of the most robust indicators of **meteorological drought**, as it responds directly to precipitation anomalies.  
- **SPEI** links **meteorological and agricultural drought**, capturing temperature-driven evaporative demand and heat-related intensification.  
- **Long-term SPI and SPEI (e.g., 12-month)** are often used as early indicators of a **developing hydrological drought**, reflecting sustained deficits across seasons.

Together, these indices provide complementary insights into how drought emerges, evolves, and impacts different components of the water cycle.

## Why drought indices?

Raw precipitation values alone don’t tell us whether a region is experiencing drought — is 50 mm of rainfall in a month “normal,” “too little,” or “a lot”?  
To answer such questions, drought indices compare current conditions to typical long-term patterns and express **how unusual** they are.

Drought indices help us:
- Compare regions with very different climates  
- Detect emerging drought early  
- Monitor severity and persistence  
- Support decision-making in agriculture, water management, and risk assessment  

ERA5-Drought focuses on climate-based indices that rely on long records of reanalysis data (ERA5).

## The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)

The **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)** (McKee et al., 1993) is one of the simplest and most widely used drought indicators.

**What it measures:**  
SPI quantifies precipitation anomalies over a chosen accumulation period relative to a long-term climatology.

Common accumulation periods:
- **SPI-1** → short-term meteorological dryness  
- **SPI-3** → seasonal impacts  
- **SPI-12** → long-term hydrological stress  

**Interpretation (WMO, 2012):**

| SPI value      | Interpretation        |
|----------------|------------------------|
| > 2.0          | Extremely wet          |
| 1.5–1.99       | Very wet               |
| 1.0–1.49       | Moderately wet         |
| -0.99–0.99     | Near normal            |
| -1.0–-1.49     | Moderately dry         |
| -1.5–-1.99     | Severely dry           |
| < -2.0         | Extremely dry          |

**Strengths**
- Simple, robust  
- Requires only precipitation  
- Comparable across climates  

**Limitations**
- Does **not** consider temperature or evaporative demand

## The Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)

The **SPEI** (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) extends SPI by including temperature-driven **evaporative demand**, which is especially relevant under climate warming.

**What it measures:**  
It uses a simple climatic water balance:

> **Water balance = Precipitation – Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)**

Hotter conditions increase PET, lowering the water balance even when rainfall is unchanged — SPEI captures this effect.

**Advantages**
- Accounts for temperature effects  
- Sensitive to heat-driven drought intensification  
- Flexible timescales (1–48 months)

**Limitations**
- Requires PET estimation (method-dependent)  
- Slightly more complex than SPI

## How ERA5-Drought uses these indices

ERA5-Drought provides **monthly global SPI and SPEI** derived from ERA5 and ERA5T reanalysis.  
All indices use a reference climatology (1991–2020, the reference period curently suggested by the World Meteorological Organisation), ensuring spatial consistency.

This makes ERA5-Drought suitable for:
- Global drought monitoring  
- Sectoral applications  
- Early-warning systems  
- Research and education
